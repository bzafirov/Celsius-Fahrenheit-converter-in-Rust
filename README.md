I just started learning Rust and this is my first project.

This is a simple program to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Once you deploy 'cargo run' you can pick which unit you would like to convert to by entering 'C' to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius or 'F' to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Current version does not have a way to exit or go back from the loop once you pick a unit to convert to, that's a feature to be added in the next version.

Another thing to add is to display only 1 fractional from a decimal, example 37.7 Celsius instead of 37.75555 Celsius.
